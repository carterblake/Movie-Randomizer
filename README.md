# Movie Randomizer

## Description

This project is a solution to today's greatest threat, not knowing what movie to watch. This project will allow a user to select one of four genres and randomly generate a movie residing within the genre. In addition to displaying information about the movie, a trailer will also automatically be searched for on YouTube. Our team learned a lot about the use of APIs throughout the process and hope that our new skills are appropriately demonstrated in the final product.
